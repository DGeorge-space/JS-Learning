//JS is dynamic weakly types, runtime compiler. 
//nothing to do with java

// client sends request to server, server responds to client with a response 
// a simple response is html 

//js skips subsequent requests by changing the existing page. compiled at runtime (unlike c++)

//can change type of a variable dynamically- as datatypes are assumed

// host environment: (not necessarily just the browser) eg server side

// can send background http requests (ajax) but js can't interact with os - node.js is an extracted chrome v8 engine which can be used on the server side

// node.js can access the local files/ os, but can't manipulate HTML/ CSS

// 3 main sections for course: basics, strong foundation, advanced concepts:
